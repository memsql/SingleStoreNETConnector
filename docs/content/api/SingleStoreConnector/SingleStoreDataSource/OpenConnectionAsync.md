public ValueTask<SingleStoreConnection> OpenConnectionAsync(
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

The returned connection is already open, and is ready for immediate use.

It is the responsibility of the caller to properly dispose the connection returned by this method. Failure to do so may result in a connection leak.
